TaskyAzure for Android
======================

Mono for Android
----------------
This sample has a very basic implementation of Microsoft's new (Sep-2012) Azure Mobile Services API.

It is loosely based on this article (ie the syntax for the REST requests)
[chrisrisner.com/Windows-Azure-Mobile-Services-and-](http://chrisrisner.com/Windows-Azure-Mobile-Services-and-iOS) however the Mono-for-Android application code is based on the existing Tasky samples (and uses MonoTouch.Dialog).

Use the [Azure Getting Started](https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started/) code to first set-up the Windows 8 sample app. The Android and Windows 8 apps will then read/write to the same TodoList !
